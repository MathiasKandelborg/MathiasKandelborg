### Hi, I love open source so much I stream it @NeonRayTracer

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him - they/them
- 😲 Standard specifications are awesome. It's almost like if everyone used them; everything would be easier.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Facts are rarely as factual as this one.

I make processor go _brrrrr_

I also love new, unique 🌠 and exciting 🤯 things, so I made a web framework containing as many of those as possible 😄

[TRUE === The Really (really) Exciting & Unique - Framework](https://github.com/MathiasKandelborg/TRUE)

TRUE is the most amazing thing you will ever experience, anyone that says otherwise, are obviously lying...

I'm not the one lying, i would never lie. I made a framework called TRUE, how could I ever make up a lie?
