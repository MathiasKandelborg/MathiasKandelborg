### Hi, I love open source so much I stream it [@NeonRayTracer](https://twitch.tv/neonraytracer/)

- Back from hiatus, what should I work on, maybe your repo? 🤔

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him - they/them
- 😲 Standard specifications are awesome. It's almost like if everyone used them; everything would be easier.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Facts are rarely as factual as this one.
- 🤭 Another not so fun fact: SystemD is very bad; Use Gentoo instead 🕶️ 💜

I make processor go _brrrrr_

I also love new, unique 🌠 and exciting 🤯 things, so I made a web framework containing as many of those as possible 😄
