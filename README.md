### Hi, I love open source so much I stream it [@NeonRayTracer](https://twitch.tv/neonraytracer/)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him - they/them
- ðŸ˜² Standard specifications are awesome. It's almost like if everyone used them; everything would be easier.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Facts are rarely as factual as this one.
- ðŸ¤­ Another not so fun fact: SystemD is very bad; if you can avoid it, please do, and please have fisticuff with me if you think it's any good!

I make processor go _brrrrr_

I also love new, unique ðŸŒ  and exciting ðŸ¤¯ things, so I made a web framework containing as many of those as possible ðŸ˜„

[TRUE === The Really (really) Exciting & Unique - Framework](https://true-framework.vercel.app/)

TRUE is the most amazing thing you will ever experience, anyone that says otherwise, are obviously lying...

I'm not the one lying, i would never lie. I made a framework called TRUE, how could I ever make up a lie?
